# Effyshell

A remake of a program I made to manage Server-Systems.
Old program had compability problems so I renewed it.

# Features

- Simple Web Interface
- IO-Handling via WebSockets (PyJsPs)
- Local Database
- Simple and neat Desktop Helper

# Todo-List

- Show in interface when a subprocess has ended using "poll"
- A simple installer
